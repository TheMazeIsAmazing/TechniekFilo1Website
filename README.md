# Philosophy of Technology 1 - End Product

This is the very first website I "made" (or rather "borrowed" a lot of example code) for a school project in Creative Media and Game Technologies.
I combined research with website development to create a one-page website exploring the history, facts, and impact of the computer mouse. The website is written in HTML and includes meta descriptions, properties, and tags, as well as a stylesheet and JavaScript file.

The website's content is organized into sections that cover various aspects of the computer mouse, such as its origins and prototypes, the work of Douglas Engelbart, the naming of the mouse, and a conclusion. Each section is accompanied by relevant images and captions to help illustrate the topic.

Overall, the project allowed me to explore the intersection of technology and philosophy, examining how inventions like the computer mouse have transformed the way we interact with and understand technology.
